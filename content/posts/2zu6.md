## Elm

### What's it good at?

- it compiles fast
- great for SPAs
- good for managing complexity at client side

### What not so...

- high cost
- communication with backend

## Event sourcing

> Store what happened over time (actions), instead of what the world looks like
> currently.

- it is complex, thus expensive
    - do we really need it?
- dropped it in favor of normal tables

## PostgreSQL

- difficult to run tests on when a lot of logic is implemented on db level
- the product was too tightly coupled to PostgreSQL

## Lenses

- complicated, you can usually do what you are trying to do without lenses

## BEM

> Block element modifier (CSS)

- only chosen because it is best practice

## Abstractions

- prematurely abstracted
- Too much coupling

## Testing

- Haskell has a culture of not testing properly
- Write the tests first
    - Tests are an amazing a feedback of the design of the system
    - when it is hard to write tests means your design is bad
- Slow tests mean your design is bad

=> That's why also Haskell programs need good testing

## CI/CD

- Did not invest enough
- you should have:
    - shortest iteration cycle

## In General

- Don't overengineer
- use fewer things
- Haskell's killer feature is that it is easily to change things over time
