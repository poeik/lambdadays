Effect system

- all you can do is in a white box
    - we pretend we can do only a few things a computer can do
- effects are handled by monads

Capability-based architecture

- supporting technology to make non-functional effects safer
- they don't perform the effects themselves
- a function needs a "key" to use a capability (like a filesystem, or a state)


## Object capabilities (OCap)

- capabilities are regular program value (like a file object)
- capability can be created (parenthood)
- capabilities can be passed to object constructors (endowment)
- capabilities can be passed in messages (introduction)

### Problems of OCaps

Not convenient!

- You need to pass a lot of parameters around
    - could be passed in a "context" object (compared to the IO monad)
- could be safer
    - problem of revocation: once an object holds a capability it can never be
      forced to give it up
    - lifetimes or sharing are hard to enforce statically
        - lifetimes lead to runtime crashes using capability

### Types can improve OCaps

- the original object capability model is untyped
- types can bring improvements:
    - implicit parameters makes them convenient
    - Tracking capabilities in types can make them safer

Why Scala? 

- Using clauses (so capabilities can be passed without boilerplate)
- Path-dependent types (we can refer to capability parameters in types)

### Capabilities example

### Capabilities for effects

```scala
def f: T throws E
def f(using CanThrow[E]): T
```

#### Capabilities and capturing types

A capturing type is of the form of `T ^ {c_1, ..., c_n}`, T is a type and c_n is
a capture set of capabilties.

A capability is a parameter or local variable, that has a type a catpuring with
nonempty capture set
