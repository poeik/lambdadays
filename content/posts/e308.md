## Programming model of infra-as-code

1. user declares the desired final state
    - e.g. resources
2. tool compares and diffs the desired state with the last known state
3. Tool computes the plan of the changes required to get to the desired state
4. Execute the IaC

## Pulumi DSL - programming infra with a real programming language

> [Besom](https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom) is a functional SDK for [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) written in Scala3

> In contrast to Terraform, Pulumi allows you to use a programming language

### IO with Besom/Pulumi

- `Input` & `Output` are building blocks
    - Output is a wrapper on a `Future`
    - Input is: `type Input[A] = A | Output[A]`
- Resource constructors create a resource
    - they are async & memoized
- Stacks
    - instance of infrastructure created by a Pulumi program
    - Output of a Pulumi/Besom program
- Components
    - Aggregations of resources
    - main use case: code reuse
    - shown as separate name spaces in the program

## Functional programming model in Besom

- Runtime is lazy

### What is an Output?

- it can easily combined with ZIO or cats effects
- functor & applicative (ap not exposed)
- It has an error channel
- Monad is normally not used, since the creation of resources are regularly
  statically known, and do not depend on a previous computation

### What is a resource constructor?

- resources are run in parallel
    - they are commutative (meaning order doesn't matter)
- resrouce ctors are memoized, meaning effects are run only once
  - sizeBucket only runs once:

```scala
    val sizeBucket = s3.Bucket(...)
    
    val x = sizeBucket.flatMap(...)
    val y = sizeBucket.flatMap(...)
```

## Yaga

> Turns apps into function on the infrastructure level

> Still research, nothing stable

- [Yaga](https://virtuslab.com/blog/scala/infrastructure-as-type-ops/#eliminating-deployment-guesswork-with-yaga) is an automated code-generation tool
- It extracts type information regarding configuration an app exposes or
  consumes
- it can be integrated in the build system
- it generates resource constructors and resources for Besom
    - it is deterministic
- Yagified apps can't be deployed incorrectly (I doubt that!)
